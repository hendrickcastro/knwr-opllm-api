# Bug Fix Outline

Use this outline when fixing bugs in the code.

## 1. Bug Identification

- [ ] Define the bug scope
- [ ] List acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identify the scope of the bug (local, global, function-specific)

## 2. Analysis

- [ ] Review related code
- [ ] Identify the root cause of the bug
- [ ] Consider potential side effects of the fix

## 3. Solution Planning

- [ ] Create high-level architecture
- [ ] Design UI/UX (if applicable)
- [ ] Identify potential technical challenges
- [ ] Design a solution
- [ ] Consider alternatives
- [ ] Evaluate impact on other parts of the code

## 4. Implementation

- [ ] Break down tasks
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Write the fix code
- [ ] Refactor and optimize if necessary

## 5. Verification

- [ ] Verify that the bug has been fixed
- [ ] Check that no new bugs have been introduced

## 6. Documentation

- [ ] Document code
- [ ] Update code documentation if necessary

## Notes

- Prioritize code readability and maintainability
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions
- Add comments to explain the "why" behind complex code
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility principle)
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully
- Keep fixes simple when possible
- Ensure full understanding of the problem before implementing a solution
- Consider if the bug might exist in other parts of the code
- Follow coding best practices and project standards
- Conduct thorough testing after the fix
- Document the solution and update existing documentation if necessary
- Consider the impact of the fix on performance and scalability
